A wrapper over [Twilight](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight) that's designed to be convenient to use, without
relying on callbacks and mostly following Twilight patterns while making your life easier

## So what does it do?

Please have a look at the docs (Code appears better there)

## Looking for Ideas

The scope of this project includes anything in Twilight that could be more convenient to use, please make an
issue for anything that falls under this category!
