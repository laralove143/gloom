# ‚ùì RC INFO

This version isn't unstable, but it includes breaking changes. This isn't published at the next minor
version to follow Twilight's version.

RCs follow different versioning, meaning RC versions are breaking only between themselves. For example `0.1.0-rc.1`
isn't breaking with `0.1.1-rc.1`, but `0.1.0-rc.2` is breaking with it
